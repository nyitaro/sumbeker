Wash and dry all produce. Dice sweet potatoes into 1\/2-inch pieces. Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack for 12 minutes (we'll roast the zucchini then). \r\n\r\n\r\n2. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, halve and core apple; thinly slice into half-moons. Peel and finely chop garlic. Quarter lemon. Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into 1\/2-inch-thick half-moons. Toss on a second baking sheet with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. \r\n\r\nPat pork dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until browned and cooked through, 4-5 minutes per side. Turn off heat; transfer to a plate. \r\n\r\n\r\n4. \r\n\r\nOnce sweet potatoes have roasted 12 minutes, transfer baking sheet with zucchini to middle rack and continue roasting until both veggies are browned and softened, 12-15 minutes more. \r\n\r\n\r\n5. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in pan used for pork over medium-high heat.
